The Private Google Calendars plugin provides a widget, shortcode and Gutenberg block. Each one has the same functionality but has to be configured differently. The configurations of the widget and Gutenberg block are almost the same as this can be done with a user interface. The shortcode configuration differs a lot because it has to be done as attributes. That's the reason you'll see more shortcode examples.

# Public calendars

## Shortcode

Use the `public` and `calendarids` attributes for displaying public calendars.

    [pgc public="true" calendarids="calendar1,calendar2"]

## Widget and Gutenberg block
